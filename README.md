# OpenSSL


__OpenSSL__ is a cryptographic toolkit library written C that is used to secure communications over computer networks. It implements the __Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)__ and
__Transport Layer Security (TLS)__ network protocols to protect against eavesdropping
and verify identities during network communication.


Create a program named __ft_ssl__ that will recreate part of the OpenSSL
functionality.


For this project, implemented the __md5__ and __sha256__ hashing functions.


__MD5__ is a cryptographic hash function. It is short for __"Message Digest 5"__. It has found to
contain several vulnerabilities, but can still be safely used as a checksum to verify data
integrity against unintentional corruption.


__SHA-256__ is one of the functions in the __SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms)__ family. The SHA
algorithms were designed by the NSA. SHA-512 is currently used in part of the process
to authenticate Debian software packages.
